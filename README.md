Odin Project: Etch-a-Sketch

This was my first project with virtually no help/reference to outside sources (aside from the occasional CSS refresher and learning to implement loops for the square-div rows.)

I felt much more comfortable than during the rock-paper-scissors assignment; I believe this is because doing that project helped me "spread my wings" and become more familiar with coding and the problem-solving mindset necessary to achieve the objective. I also referenced outside sources a lot with rock-paper-scissors. Forcing myself to use all that I have learned up to this point without reliance on much outside information has ultimately benefited me.
